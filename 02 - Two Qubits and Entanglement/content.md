We know how to combine classical bits, it’s just the binary number system. For example, the combinations of 2 bits have exactly 4 possible states, namely 00, 01, 10 and 11. 

Just as we saw that the quantum bit can be considered a “mix” of +1 and -1 states, so can the combination of quantum bits be considered a “mix” of all of their possible configurations, although unfortunately there is no easy way to visualise the whole states space as there is with a single quantum bit.

What’s remarkable is that the possible combinations of states have many more configurations than could produced from two single quantum bits working separately. Let that sink in. Two linked, or entangled, quantum bits can be in a state which is not a combination of individual bits! What is more, these states can be reached by applying certain quantum gates and what results is a state which cannot, even in theory, be considered a product of two bits alone. It is this remarkable fact that gives quantum computing it’s immense power.
