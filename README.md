# A Course in Quantum Computing for Software Engineers

The crazy world of quantum mechanics can be difficult to absorb due to the heavy mathematical language that is required to express it. In this course I’ve tried to express the power and beauty of quantum computing in a way that any software engineer can understand. This is the course that I wanted to do. I hope it’s of some use to someone.

Using practical exercises it takes the student through from an intuitive understanding of the qubit through to quantum algorithms.

Each section of the course is organised into an explanation of basic concepts with the minumum maths followed by one or more programming exercises which introduce the mathematics and reenforce understanding with practical use. Each exercise builds on the last culminating in a basic working quantum computing simulator.
