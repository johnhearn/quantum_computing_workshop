# Quantum Computing Workshop for Programmers

The world of quantum computing can be difficult to absorb at first, partly due to the unintuitive nature of quantum mechanics and the heavy mathematical language that is required to express it. In this workshop I’ve tried to express the power and beauty of quantum computing in a way that any software engineer can understand. 

Using practical exercises it takes the student through from an intuitive understanding of the qubit through to quantum algorithms.

Each section of the course is organised into an explanation of basic concepts with the minumum maths followed by one or more programming exercises which introduce the mathematics and reenforce understanding with practical use. Each exercise builds on the last culminating in a basic working quantum computing simulator.

This is the course that I wanted to do. I hope it’s of some use to someone.


## Introduction to the Qubit

Exercises: superdense coding, teleportation

(Concepts: tensor product of states and operators, entanglement)

## Multiple Qubits

- Composing several unitary gates (2^n)
- Oracles

Exercises: recursive tensor product, Grover's Search

## Further Topics

- Factoring a composite integer (Shor's Algorithm)
